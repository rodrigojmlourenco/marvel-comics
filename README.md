# Android Skeleton :skull_and_crossbones:  
  
This project is a bare-bones setup of an Android project with my prefered tech-stack. It subscribes to an MVVM architecture, as well as a single activity navigation, both powered by [Android Jetpack](https://material.io/develop/android/).  
  
The project includes a separate library module `:design`. The purpose of this module is to easy maintain and ascertain the state of a collection of [material design components](https://material.io/develop/android/)
